# Ponytail Rule

Makes your AI agent think like the laziest senior dev in the room. The best code is the code you never wrote.

Before writing code, the agent stops at the first rung that holds:

1. Does this need to exist?   → no: skip it (YAGNI)
2. Already in this codebase?  → reuse it, don't rewrite
3. Stdlib does it?            → use it
4. Native platform feature?   → use it
5. Installed dependency?      → use it
6. One line?                  → one line
7. Only then: the minimum that works

The ladder runs *after* it understands the problem, not instead of it: it reads the code the change touches and traces the real flow before picking a rung. Lazy about the solution, never about reading.

Lazy, not negligent: trust-boundary validation, data-loss handling, security, and accessibility are never on the chopping block.
